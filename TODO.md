# TODO
A list of post ideas that would be interesting to research and write about
* libuv under the hood
  * trace tcp listen/send/recv - lots of interesting stuff around the correct
way to setup sockets, EINTR etc (uv_accept etc) (can supplement with 
UNIX network programming notes)
  * file io

* trace redis read query / query buffer / protocol parser
* redis cluster
* libuv
* seastar
* tokio
* Consul
* Redpanda tracing
* Golang goroutines
* Cassandra tracing
* Cassandra storage engine
* Chord
* Why is changed memory between cores slow (seastar)
